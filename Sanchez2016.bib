abstract = {We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to show that a significant fraction of the gas in high redshift rare massive haloes falls nearly radially to their very centre on extremely short time-scales. This process results in the formation of very compact bulges with specific angular momentum a factor of 5-30 smaller than the average angular momentum of the baryons in the whole halo. Such low angular momentum originates from both segregation and effective cancellation when the gas flows to the centre of the halo along well-defined cold filamentary streams. These filaments penetrate deep inside the halo and connect to the bulge from multiple rapidly changing directions. Structures falling in along the filaments (satellite galaxies) or formed by gravitational instabilities triggered by the inflow (star clusters) further reduce the angular momentum of the gas in the bulge. Finally, the fraction of gas radially falling to the centre appears to increase with the mass of the halo; we argue that this is most likely due to an enhanced cancellation of angular momentum in rarer haloes which are fed by more isotropically distributed cold streams. Such an increasingly efficient funnelling of low angular momentum gas to the centre of very massive haloes at high redshift may account for the rapid pace at which the most massive supermassive black holes grow to reach observed masses around 109 M⊙ at an epoch when the Universe is barely 1 Gyr old.},

abstract = {The growth of the most massive black holes in the early universe, consistent with the detection of highly luminous quasars at {\$}z{\textgreater} 6{\$} implies sustained, critical accretion of material to grow and power them. Given a black hole seed scenario, it is still uncertain which conditions in the early Universe allow the fastest black hole growth. Large scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of structure formation allow us to explore the conditions conducive to the growth of the earliest supermassive black holes. We use the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides, which incorporates a variety of baryon physics in a (400 Mpc/h){\^{}}3 volume with 0.7 trillion particles to follow the earliest phases of black hole critical growth. At z=8 the most massive black holes (a handful) approach masses of 10{\^{}}8 Msun with the most massive (with M{\_}BH = 4 x 10{\^{}}8 Msun ) being found in an extremely compact spheroid-dominated host galaxy. Examining the large-scale environment of hosts, we find that the initial tidal field is more important than overdensity in setting the conditions for early BH growth. In regions of low tidal fields gas accretes 'cold' onto the black hole and falls along thin, radial filaments straight into the center forming the most compact galaxies and most massive black holes at earliest times. Regions of high tidal fields instead induce larger coherent angular momenta and influence the formation of the first population of massive compact disks. The extreme early growth depends on the early interplay of high gas densities and the tidal field that shapes the mode of accretion. Mergers play a minor role in the formation of the first generation, rare massive BHs.},

abstract = {Observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the mass of the central dark object MBH and the velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the host galaxy, of the form log(MBH/Msolar)=$\alpha$+$\beta$log($\sigma$/ $\sigma$0) however, published estimates of the slope $\beta$ span a wide range (3.75-5.3). Merritt {\&} Ferrarese have argued that low slopes ({\textless}{\~{}}4) arise because of neglect of random measurement errors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of the Milky Way Galaxy. We show that these explanations and several others account for at most a small part of the slope range. Instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because of systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups for the same galaxies. The origin of these differences remains unclear, but we suggest that one significant component of the difference results from Ferrarese {\&} Merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to re/8 (re is the effective radius) using an empirical formula. Another component may arise from dispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. A new determination of the slope using 31 galaxies yields $\beta$=4.02+/-0.32, $\alpha$=8.13+/-0.06 for $\sigma$0=200 km s-1. The MBH-$\sigma$ relation has an intrinsic dispersion in logMBH that is no larger than 0.25-0.3 dex and may be smaller if observational errors have been underestimated. In an appendix, we present a simple kinematic model for the velocity-dispersion profile of the Galactic bulge.},

@article{Sijacki2007,
abstract = {We discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of structure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmic population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Our model assumes that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos. We then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be in a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. For black holes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous environment. Using our new model, we carry out TreeSPH cosmological simulations on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their star formation history, their amount of cold gas, and their colours. Also, the properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows.

abstract = {{We provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 Re of a volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe, using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the ATLAS3D project. We exploit the LambdaR parameter to characterise the existence of two families of ETGs: Slow Rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields and often include stellar kinematically Distinct Cores (KDCs), and Fast Rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs leads to a new criterion to disentangle Fast and Slow Rotators which now includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (Epsilon). It separates the two classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than a criterion based on V/Sigma: Slow Rotators and Fast Rotators have LambdaR lower and larger than kFSxSQRT(Epsilon), respectively, where kFS=0.31 for measurements made within 1 Re. We show that the vast majority of early-type galaxies are Fast Rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with aligned photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II, Krajnovic et al. 2011{\}}, include discs and often bars and represent 86{\%} (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample. Fast Rotators span the full range of apparent ellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are Slow Rotators representing 14{\%} (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all Slow Rotators, 11{\%} (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components and are rather low mass objects (Mdyn{\textless}10{\^{}}10.5 M{\_}Sun). All other Slow Rotators (32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (Epsilon{\_}e{\textless}0.4), tend to be massive (Mdyn{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10.5 M{\_}Sun), and often (17/32) exhibit KDCs.},

abstract = {We investigate the nature of gas accretion on to haloes and galaxies at z = 2 using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code AREPO. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches, we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of accreted gas in massive haloes above ≃1010.5 M⊙. In agreement with previous work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, for instance, {\textless}20 per cent in haloes with Mhalo ≃ 1011 M⊙. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, together with a cold accretion rate which is lower by a factor of 2. These discrepancies increase for more massive systems, and we explain both trends in terms of numerical inaccuracies with the standard formulation of SPH. We note, however, that changes in the treatment of interstellar medium physics - feedback, in particular - could modify the observed differences between codes as well as the relative importance of different accretion modes. We explore these differences by evaluating several ways of measuring a cold mode of accretion. As in previous work, the maximum past temperature of gas is compared to either a constant threshold value or some fraction of the virial temperature of each parent halo. We find that the relatively sharp transition from cold- to hot-mode-dominated accretion at halo masses of ≃1011 M⊙ is a consequence of the constant temperature criterion, which can only separate virialized gas above some minimum halo mass. Examining the spatial distribution of accreting gas, we find that the filamentary geometry of accreting gas near the virial radius is a common feature in massive haloes above ≃1011.5 M⊙. Gas filaments in GADGET, however, tend to remain collimated and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large number of purely numerical `blobs'. These same filamentary gas streams in AREPO show increased heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5rvir and contribute to the hot gas accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.},

We find that the average central star formation rate (SFR) enhancement (x 3.5) and the fraction of starbursts (20 per cent) peak in the post-merger sample. The post-mergers also show a stronger deficit in gas phase metallicity than the closest pairs, being more metal-poor than their control by -0.09 dex. Combined with the observed trends in SFR and the timescales predicted in merger simulations, we estimate that the post-mergers in our sample have undergone coalescence within the last few hundred Myr. In contrast with the incidence of star-forming galaxies, the frequency of active galactic nuclei (AGN) peaks in the post-mergers, outnumbering AGN in the control sample by a factor of 3.75. Moreover, amongst the galaxies that host an AGN, the black hole accretion rates in the closest pairs and post-mergers are higher by a factor of {\~{}}3 than AGN in the control sample. These results are consistent with a picture in which star formation is initiated early on in the encounter, with AGN activity peaking post-coalescence.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are evolutionarily young objects, powered by accretion onto central black holes that are significantly lower in mass than those found in typical broad-line Seyfert galaxies. We explore this hypothesis through the analysis of high spatial resolution, near-IR imaging data. By employing the correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, we determine the mean black hole mass for our sample to be, in solar units, {\textless}log(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BH{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textgreater}=7.9. Using the correlation between the size of the broad-line region and the monochromatic continuum luminosity, we obtain black hole mass estimates under the assumption that the emission-line gas is in virial equilibrium. The mean black hole mass derived from this relation is {\textless}log(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BH{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textgreater}=6.4. We explore possible causes for this discrepancy in M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BH{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} estimates and the ramifications for our understanding of the role played by NLS1s in AGN evolution. Because numerical simulations constrain the start of the AGN duty cycle to a time shortly after a gravitational interaction, we examine the morphology and near-IR bulge colors of the NLS1 sample for evidence of recent encounters. The mean bulge color is found to be redder than that of both a matched sample of nonactive galaxies and published estimates for broad-line Seyfert galaxies. The source of the unusual bulge colors may be an excess of flux, peaking at 2.2 $\mu$m, that has been detected near the centers of some NLS1s. No evidence is found for light asymmetries or an extra stellar component that would indicate NLS1s are young objects. Finally, we postulate that there may be some interesting lines of circumstantial evidence suggesting that secular processes may be relevant in NLS1s.},

The mean ratio of black hole mass to bulge mass was until recently very uncertain, with ground based, stellar kinematical data giving a value roughly an order of magnitude larger than other techniques. The discrepancy was resolved with the discovery of the M-sigma relation, which simultaneously established a tight corrrelation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion, and confirmed that the stellar kinematical mass estimates were systematically too large due to failure to resolve the black hole's sphere of influence. There is now excellent agreement between the various techniques for estimating the mean black hole mass, including dynamical mass estimation in quiescent galaxies; reverberation mapping in active galaxies and quasars; and computation of the mean density of compact objects based on integrated quasar light. Implications of the M-sigma relation for the formation of black holes are discussed.},

abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of AGN can be divided into two distinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of {\~{}}1{\%} of the Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black holes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these black holes in {\~{}}10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear environment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback will be generic in these objects and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGN. In Jet-Mode AGN the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGN are associated with the more massive black holes in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these black holes nor star-formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGN are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift universe are painting a similar picture. (Abridged).},

@article{Fu2008,
abstract = {We give an overview of our recent integral-field-unit spectroscopy of luminous extended emission-line regions (EELRs) around low-redshift quasars, including new observations of 5 fields. Previous work has shown that the most luminous EELRs are found almost exclusively around steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars, with apparently disordered global velocity fields, and little, if any, morphological correlation with either the host-galaxy or the radio structure. Our new observations confirm and expand these results. The EELRs often show some clouds with velocities exceeding 500 km/s, ranging up to 1100 km/s, but the velocity dispersions, with few exceptions, are in the 30-100 km/s range. Emission-line ratios show that the EELRs are clearly photoionized by the quasars. Masses of the EELRs range up to {\textgreater}10{\^{}}10 Msun. Essentially all of the EELRs show relatively low metallicities, and they are associated with quasars that, in contrast to most, show similarly low metallicities in their broad-line regions. The two objects in our sample that do not have classical double-lobed radio morphologies (3C48, with a compact-steep-spectrum source; Mrk1014, radio-quiet, but with a weak compact-steep-spectrum source) are the only ones that appear to have recent star formation. While some of the less-luminous EELRs may have other origins, the most likely explanation for the ones in our sample is that they are examples of gas swept out of the host galaxy by a large-solid-angle blast wave accompanying the production of the radio jets. The triggering of the quasar activity is almost certainly the result of the merger of a gas-rich galaxy with a massive, gas-poor galaxy hosting the supermassive black hole.},

abstract = {We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M{\_}bh. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M{\_}bh and Upsilon; the four galaxies that cannot be fit have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fit galaxies are consistent with the fundamental plane correlation Upsilon $\backslash$propto L{\^{}}0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95{\%} confidence level an MDO of mass M{\_}bh {\~{}} 0.006 M{\_}bulge = 0.006 Upsilon L. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M{\_}bh=0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M{\_}bh. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f {\~{}}0.97 of galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M{\_}bh/M{\_}bulge) of mean -2.27 and width {\~{}}0.07.},

abstract = {We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with observations.},

abstract = {New kinematic data and modeling efforts in the past few years have substantially expanded and revised dynamical measurements of black hole masses (Mbh) at the centers of nearby galaxies. Here we compile an updated sample of 72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relations between Mbh and stellar velocity dispersion (sigma), V-band luminosity (L), and bulge stellar mass (Mbulge), for different galaxy subsamples. Our best-fitting power law relations for the full galaxy sample are log(Mbh) = 8.33 + 5.57*log(sigma/200 kms), log(Mbh) = 9.23 + 1.11*log(L/10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} Lsun), and log(Mbh) = 8.46 + 1.05*log(Mbulge/10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} Msun). A log-quadratic fit to the Mbh-sigma relation with an additional term of beta{\_}2*[log(sigma/200 kms)]{\^{}}2 gives beta{\_}2 = 1.52 +/- 1.95 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in Mbh. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain nearly identical slopes of {\~{}}5.1 for the Mbh-sigma relation but significantly different intercepts -- Mbh in early-type galaxies are about 2 times higher than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to Mbh(sigma) give Mbh that is about 2 times higher in galaxies with central core profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our Mbh-L and Mbh-Mbulge relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier compilations. When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the intrinsic scatter in Mbh, our dataset shows weak evidence for increased scatter at Mbulge {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} Msun or L{\_}V {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}10.3{\}} Lsun, while the scatter stays constant for 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} {\textless} Mbulge {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}12.3{\}} Msun and 10{\^{}}{\{}10.3{\}} {\textless} L{\_}V {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}11.5{\}} Lsun. A Bayesian analysis indicates a larger sample of Mbh measurements would be needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter with galaxy properties.},

@article{Alexander2005,
abstract = {The tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroids in nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these two components. Optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black holes in the Universe, and can account for greater than or approximately equal to 30 per cent of the total cosmological black-hole growth. As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star formation and already host massive black holes ({\textgreater} 10(8)M(o), where M(o) is the solar mass), there must have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew (mass range approximately (10(6)-10(8))M(o)). The likely signature of this earlier stage is simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (redshift z {\textgreater} 1; {\textgreater}8 billion light years away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray observations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost continuously throughout periods of intense star formation. This activity appears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval galaxy populations. We show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies is consistent with that expected for the pre-quasar phase.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical investigations have suggested that the formation of the very first stars, forming out of metal-free gas, was fundamentally different from the present-day case. In this paper, we study the effect of metallicity on the evolution of the gas in a collapsing dark matter mini-halo. We model such a system as an isolated 3$\backslash$sigma peak of mass 2x10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun that collapses at z{\_}coll=30, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The gas has a supposed level of pre-enrichment of either 10{\^{}}-4 Z{\_}sun or 10{\^{}}-3 Z{\_}sun. We find that the evolution proceeds very differently for the two cases. The gas in the lower metallicity simulation fails to undergo continued collapse and fragmentation, whereas the gas in the higher metallicity case dissipatively settles into the center of the dark matter halo. The central gas, characterized by densities n {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}4 cm{\^{}}-3, and a temperature, T $\backslash$sim 90 K, which closely follows that of the CMB, is gravitationally unstable and undergoes vigorous fragmentation. We discuss the physical reason for the existence of a critical metallicity, Z{\_}crit $\backslash$sim 5x10{\^{}}-4 Z{\_}sun, and its possible dependence on redshift. Compared to the pure H/He case, the fragmentation of the 10{\^{}}-3 Z{\_}sun gas leads to a larger relative number of low-mass clumps.},

abstract = {We use numerical simulations to study the kinematic structure of remnants formed from mergers of equal-mass disk galaxies. In particular, we show that remnants of dissipational mergers, which include the radiative cooling of gas, star formation, feedback from supernovae, and the growth of supermassive black holes, are smaller, rounder, have, on average, a larger central velocity dispersion, and show significant rotation compared to remnants of dissipationless mergers. The increased rotation speed of dissipational remnants owes its origin to star formation that occurs in the central regions during the galaxy merger. We have further quantified the anisotropy, three-dimensional shape, minor-axis rotation, and isophotal shape of each merger remnant, finding that dissipational remnants are more isotropic, closer to oblate, have the majority of their rotation along their major axis, and are more disky than dissipationless remnants. Individual remnants display a wide variety of kinematic properties. A large fraction of the dissipational remnants are oblate isotropic rotators. Many dissipational remnants, and all of the dissipationless ones, are slowly rotating and anisotropic. The remnants of gas-rich major mergers can well reproduce the observed distribution of projected ellipticities, rotation parameter (V/$\sigma$)*, kinematic misalignments, $\Psi$, and isophotal shapes. The dissipationless remnants are a poor match to this data. We also investigate the properties of merger remnants as a function of initial disk gas fraction, orbital angular momentum, and the mass of the progenitor galaxies. Our results support the merger hypothesis for the origin of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies provided that the progenitor disks are sufficiently gas-rich, however our remnants are a poor match to the bright ellipticals that are slowly rotating and uniformly boxy.},

abstract = {Massive galaxies in the young Universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are 'stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

abstract = {We use a sample of rest-frame UV-selected and spectroscopically observed galaxies at redshifts 1.9{\textless}=z{\textless}3.4, combined with ground-based spectroscopic H$\alpha$ and Spitzer MIPS 24 $\mu$m data, to derive the most robust measurements of the rest-frame UV, H$\alpha$, and infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) at these redshifts. Our sample is by far the largest of its kind, with over 2000 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 1.9{\textless}=z{\textless}3.4 and {\~{}}15,000 photometric candidates in 29 independent fields covering a total area of almost a square degree. Our method for computing the LFs takes into account a number of systematic effects, including photometric scatter, Ly$\alpha$ line perturbations to the observed optical colors of galaxies, and contaminants. Taking into account the latter, we find no evidence for an excess of UV-bright galaxies over what was inferred in early z{\~{}}3 LBG studies. The UV LF appears to undergo little evolution between z{\~{}}4 and z{\~{}}2. Corrected for extinction, the UV luminosity density (LD) at z{\~{}}2 is at least as large as the value at z{\~{}}3 and a factor of {\~{}}9 larger than the value at z{\~{}}6, primarily reflecting an increase in the number density of bright galaxies between z{\~{}}6 and z{\~{}}2. Our analysis yields the first constraints anchored by extensive spectroscopy on the infrared and bolometric LFs for faint and moderately luminous (Lbol{\textless}{\~{}}1012 Lsolar) galaxies. Adding the IR to the emergent UV luminosity, incorporating independent measurements of the LD from ULIRGs, and assuming realistic dust attenuation values for UV-faint galaxies, indicates that galaxies with Lbol{\textless}1012 Lsolar account for {\~{}}80{\%} of the bolometric LD and SFRD at z{\~{}}2-3. This suggests that previous estimates of the faint end of the Lbol LF may have underestimated the steepness of the faint-end slope at Lbol{\textless}1012 Lsolar. Our multiwavelength constraints on the global SFRD indicate that approximately one-third of the present-day stellar mass density was formed in subultraluminous galaxies between redshifts z=1.9-3.4.

Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

abstract = {We use multiscale smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to study the inflow of gas from galactic scales ({\~{}}10kpc) down to {\textless}{\~{}} 0.1pc, at which point the gas begins to resemble a traditional, Keplerian accretion disc. The key ingredients of the simulations are gas, stars, black holes (BHs), self-gravity, star formation and stellar feedback (via a subgrid model); BH feedback is not included. We use {\~{}}100 simulations to survey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the interstellar medium physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic nuclei ({\textless}{\~{}} 300pc) using galaxy-scale simulations, including both major galaxy mergers and isolated bar-(un)stable disc galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems, we find that a series of gravitational instabilities generates large accretion rates of up to {\~{}} 1-10 Msolar yr-1 on to the BH (i.e. at {\textless}{\~{}} 0.1pc) this is comparable to what is needed to fuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable for a given set of conditions in the galaxy at {\~{}}kpc. At radii of {\textgreater}rsim 10 pc, our simulations resemble the `bars-within-bars' model of Shlosman et al., but we show that the gas can have a diverse array of morphologies, including spirals, rings, clumps and bars; the duty cycle of these features is modest, complicating attempts to correlate BH accretion with the morphology of gas in galactic nuclei. At {\~{}} 1-10 pc, the gravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no longer present. However, we show that the gas can become unstable to a standing, eccentric disc or a single-armed spiral mode (m = 1), in which the stars and gas precess at different rates, driving the gas to sub-pc scales (again for sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems). A proper treatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity of both the stars and gas (which has not been the case in many previous calculations). Our simulations predict a correlation between the BH accretion rate and the star formation rate at different galactic radii. We find that nuclear star formation is more tightly coupled to active galactic nucleus activity than the global star formation rate of a galaxy, but a reasonable correlation remains even for the latter.},

Five new main components are added to our radiative transfer code CUBA: (1) the sawtooth modulation of the background intensity from resonant line absorption in the Lyman series of cosmic hydrogen and helium; (2) the X-ray emission from the obscured and unobscured quasars that gives origin to the X-ray background; (3) a piecewise parameterization of the distribution in redshift and column density of intergalactic absorbers that fits recent measurements of the mean free path of 1 ryd photons; (4) an accurate treatment of the photoionization structure of absorbers, which enters in the calculation of the helium continuum opacity and recombination emissivity; and (5) the UV emission from star-forming galaxies at all redshifts. We provide tables of the predicted H I and He II photoionization and photoheating rates for use, e.g., in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and a new metallicity-dependent calibration to the UV luminosity density-star formation rate density relation. A "minimal cosmic reionization model" is also presented in which the galaxy UV emissivity traces recent determinations of the cosmic history of star formation, the luminosity-weighted escape fraction of hydrogen-ionizing radiation increases rapidly with look-back time, the clumping factor of the high-redshift intergalactic medium evolves following the results of hydrodynamic simulations, and Population III stars and miniquasars make a negligible contribution to the metagalactic flux. The model provides a good fit to the hydrogen-ionization rates inferred from flux decrement and proximity effect measurements, predicts that cosmological H II (He III) regions overlap at redshift 6.7 (2.8), and yields an optical depth to Thomson scattering, $\tau$es = 0.084 that is in agreement with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe results. Our new background intensities and spectra are sensitive to a number of poorly determined input parameters and suffer from various degeneracies. Their predictive power should be constantly tested against new observations. We are therefore making our redshift-dependent UV/X emissivities and CUBA outputs freely available for public use at http://www.ucolick.org/{\~{}}pmadau/CUBA.},

abstract = {We investigate the coupled formation and evolution of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure formation. For the first time, we self-consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative gas cooling, and star formation, as well as BH growth and associated feedback processes, starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the LambdaCDM cosmology. Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on an approach that we have developed in simulations of isolated galaxy mergers. Here we examine (1) the predicted global history of BH mass assembly, (2) the evolution of the local black hole-host mass correlations, and (3) the conditions that allow rapid growth of the first quasars, and the properties of their hosts and descendants today. We find a total BH mass density in good agreement with observational estimates. The BH accretion rate density peaks at lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the star formation rate density, but the ratio of black hole to stellar mass density shows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find strong correlations between BH masses and properties of the stellar systems, agreeing well with the measured local MBH-sigma and MBH-M* relationships, but also suggesting (dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in the normalization and the slope. Our simulations also produce massive black holes at high redshift, due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions that collapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows. These first supermassive BH systems, however, are not necessarily the most massive ones today, since they are often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later.},

abstract = {The existence of massive black holes (MBHs) was postulated in the 1960s, when the first quasars were discovered. In the late 1990s their reality was proven beyond doubt in the Milky way and a handful nearby galaxies. Since then, enormous theoretical and observational efforts have been made to understand the astrophysics of MBHs. We have discovered that some of the most massive black holes known, weighing billions of solar masses, powered luminous quasars within the first billion years of the Universe. The first MBHs must therefore have formed around the time the first stars and galaxies formed. Dynamical evidence also indicates that black holes with masses of millions to billions of solar masses ordinarily dwell in the centers of today's galaxies. MBHs populate galaxy centers today, and shone as quasars in the past; the quiescent black holes that we detect now in nearby bulges are the dormant remnants of this fiery past. In this review we report on basic, but critical, questions regarding the cosmological significance of MBHs. What physical mechanisms led to the formation of the first MBHs? How massive were the initial MBH seeds? When and where did they form? How is the growth of black holes linked to that of their host galaxy? The answers to most of these questions are works in progress, in the spirit of these reports on progress in physics.},

We use 100 and 160 $\mu$ m fluxes from GOODS-Herschel - the deepest survey yet undertaken by the Herschel telescope - and show that in the vast majority of cases (i.e. {\textgreater}94 per cent) these fluxes are dominated by emission from the host galaxy. As such, these far-infrared bands provide an uncontaminated view of star formation in the AGN host galaxies. We find no evidence of any correlation between the X-ray and infrared luminosities of moderate AGNs at any redshift, suggesting that global star formation is decoupled from nuclear (i.e. AGN) activity in these galaxies. On the other hand, we confirm that the star formation rates of AGN hosts increase strongly with redshift, by a factor of 43+27- 18 from z {\textless} 0.1 to z = 2-3 for AGNs with the same range of X-ray luminosities. This increase is entirely consistent with the factor of 25-50 increase in the specific star formation rates (SSFRs) of normal, star-forming (i.e. main-sequence) galaxies over the same redshift range. Indeed, the average SSFRs of AGN hosts are only marginally (i.e. ≈20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies at all surveyed redshifts, with this small deficit being due to a fraction of AGNs residing in quiescent (i.e. low SSFR) galaxies. We estimate that 79 ± 10 per cent of moderate-luminosity AGNs are hosted in main-sequence galaxies, 15 ± 7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and {\textless}10 per cent in strongly starbursting galaxies. We derive the fractions of all main-sequence galaxies at z {\textless} 2 that are experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity, noting that it is strongly dependent on galaxy stellar mass (Mstars), rising from just a few per cent at Mstars˜ 1010 M⊙ to ≳20 per cent at Mstars≥ 1011 M⊙. Our results indicate that it is galaxy stellar mass that is most important in dictating whether a galaxy hosts a moderate-luminosity AGN. We argue that the majority of moderate nuclear activity is fuelled by internal mechanisms rather than violent mergers, which suggests that high-redshift disc instabilities could be an important AGN feeding mechanism.},

abstract = {We use high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to demonstrate that cold flow gas accretion, particularly along filaments, modifies the standard picture of gas accretion and cooling onto galaxy disks. In the standard picture, all gas is initially heated to the virial temperature of the galaxy as it enters the virial radius. Low mass galaxies are instead dominated by accretion of gas that stays well below the virial temperature, and even when a hot halo is able to develop in more massive galaxies there exist dense filaments that penetrate inside of the virial radius and deliver cold gas to the central galaxy. For galaxies up to {\~{}}L*, this cold accretion gas is responsible for the star formation in the disk at all times to the present. Even for galaxies at higher masses, cold flows dominate the growth of the disk at early times. Within this modified picture, galaxies are able to accrete a large mass of cold gas, with lower initial gas temperatures leading to shorter cooling times to reach the disk. Although star formation in the disk is mitigated by supernovae feedback, the short cooling times allow for the growth of stellar disks at higher redshifts than predicted by the standard model.},

abstract = {The formation of quasar black holes during the hydrodynamic collapse of protogalactic gas clouds is discussed. The dissipational collapse and long- term dynamical evolution of these systems is analysed using three-dimensional numerical simulations. The calculations focus on the final collapse stages of the inner baryonic component and therefore ignore the presence of dark matter. Two types of initial conditions are considered: uniformly rotating spherical clouds, and irrotational ellipsoidal clouds. In both cases the clouds are initially cold, homogeneous, and not far from rotational support ({\$}T/|W| \backslashapprox 0.1{\$}). Although the details of the dynamical evolution depend sensitively on the initial conditions, the qualitative features of the final configurations do not. Most of the gas is found to fragment into small dense clumps, that eventually make up a spheroidal component resembling a galactic bulge. About 5$\backslash${\%} of the initial mass remains in the form of a smooth disk of gas supported by rotation in the gravitational potential well of the outer spheroid. If a central seed black hole of mass {\$}\backslashgsim10{\^{}}6M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} forms, it can grow by steady accretion from the disk and reach a typical quasar black hole mass {\$}\backslashsim10{\^{}}8M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} in less than {\$}5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}8\backslash,{\$}yr. In the absence of a sufficiently massive seed, dynamical instabilities in a strongly self- gravitating inner region of the disk will inhibit steady accretion of gas and may prevent the immediate formation of a quasar.},

abstract = {We present new accurate near-infrared (NIR) spheroid (bulge) structural parameters obtained by two-dimensional image analysis for all galaxies with a direct black hole (BH) mass determination. As expected, NIR bulge luminosities Lbul and BH masses are tightly correlated, and if we consider only those galaxies with secure BH mass measurement and accurate Lbul (27 objects), the spread of MBH-Lbul is similar to MBH-sigma, where sigma is the effective stellar velocity dispersion. We find an intrinsic rms scatter of {\~{}}0.3 dex in log MBH. By combining the bulge effective radii R{\_}e measured in our analysis with sigma, we find a tight linear correlation (rms {\~{}} 0.25 dex) between MBH and the virial bulge mass (propto R{\_}e sigma{\^{}}2), with {\textless}MBH/Mbul{\textgreater} {\~{}} 0.002. A partial correlation analysis shows that MBH depends on both sigma and R{\_}e, and that both variables are necessary to drive the correlations between MBH and other bulge properties.},

@article{Dehnen2012,
abstract = {The numerical convergence of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can be severely restricted by random force errors induced by particle disorder, especially in shear flows, which are ubiquitous in astrophysics. The increase in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher-order B-splines, allowing large NH and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sub-linear with NH). Our analysis also shows that at low NH the quartic spline kernel with NH {\~{}}= 60 obtains much better convergence then the standard cubic spline.},

Stellar dynamical models which allow for anisotropic velocity dispersions have been constructed using the maximum entropy technique. These three-dimensional models have been projected in the plane of the sky and convolved with the seeing profile and finite slit width using a new technique that constructs synthetic spectra. These spectra are then analyzed in exactly the same manner as the real data. The authors conclude that constant M/L models are ruled out for both systems, regardless of the degree of anisotropy of the velocity dispersions.

abstract = {We examine the temperature history of gas accreted by forming galaxies in SPH simulations. About half the gas shock heats to roughly the virial temperature of the galaxy potential well before cooling, condensing, and forming stars, but the other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lower temperatures, typically T{\textless}10{\^{}}5 K, and the histogram of maximum gas temperatures is clearly bimodal. The "cold mode" of gas accretion dominates for low mass galaxies (M{\_}baryon {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}10.3{\}}Msun or M{\_}halo {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}11.4{\}}Msun), while the conventional "hot mode" dominates the growth of high mass systems. Cold accretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficiently draw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. The galaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of cold and hot accretion rates, with cold mode dominating at high redshift and in low density regions today, and hot mode dominating in group and cluster environments at low redshift. Star formation rates closely track accretion rates, and we discuss the physics behind the observed environment and redshift dependence of galactic scale star formation. If we allowed hot accretion to be suppressed by conduction or AGN feedback, then the simulation predictions would change in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colors of ellipticals and the cutoff of the galaxy luminosity function. The transition between cold and hot accretion at M{\_}h {\~{}} 10{\^{}}{\{}11.4{\}}Msun is similar to that found by Birnboim {\&} Dekel (2003) using 1-d simulations and analytic arguments. The corresponding baryonic mass is tantalizingly close to the scale at which Kauffmann et al. (2003) find a marked shift in galaxy properties. We speculate on connections between these theoretical and observational transitions.},

We perform a detailed modeling of the expected rates and yields of type II (SNII) and type Ia (SNIa) supernovae to follow the metal enrichment history of this Galaxy model for 8Gyr. At this time, which we identify with the time of formation of the Sun, roughly two thirds of the Galactic iron have been synthesized in SNIa, while 98{\%} of the Galactic oxygen is due to SNII events. Our results compare favorably with observational constraints such as the age-metallicity relation, the correlation between [O/Fe] and [Fe/H], and the O and Fe abundances in the solar neighborhood.},

abstract = {We use numerical simulations to examine the structure of merger remnants resulting from collisions of gas-rich spiral galaxies. When the gas fraction of the progenitors is small, the remnants structurally and kinematically resemble elliptical galaxies, in agreement with earlier work. However, if the progenitor disks are gas-dominated, new types of outcomes are possible, where a prominent disk may survive in certain cases. To illustrate this scenario, we analyze an extreme example with progenitor galaxies consisting of dark matter halos, pure gas disks, and no bulges, as might be appropriate for mergers at high redshifts. While rapid star formation triggered by tidal torques during the merger forms a central, rotating bulge in the remnant, not all the gas is consumed in the burst. The remaining gas cools quickly and settles into an extended star-forming disk, yielding an object similar to a spiral galaxy and not an early-type galaxy. This is contrary to the usual view that major mergers invariably destroy disks. The morphological evolution of galaxies can therefore be more complicated than often assumed, and in particular, theoretical constraints based on the fragility of spiral disks need to be reevaluated.},

abstract = {We examine the scalings of galactic outflows with halo mass across a suite of twenty high-resolution cosmological zoom galaxy simulations covering halo masses from 10{\^{}}9.5 - 10{\^{}}12 M{\_}sun. These simulations self-consistently generate outflows from the available supernova energy in a manner that successfully reproduces key galaxy observables including the stellar mass-halo mass, Tully-Fisher, and mass-metallicity relations. We quantify the importance of ejective feedback to setting the stellar mass relative to the efficiency of gas accretion and star formation. Ejective feedback is increasingly important as galaxy mass decreases; we find an effective mass loading factor that scales as v{\_}circ{\^{}}(-2.2), with an amplitude and shape that is invariant with redshift. These scalings are consistent with analytic models for energy-driven wind, based solely on the halo potential. Recycling is common: about half the outflow mass across all galaxy masses is later re-accreted. The recycling timescale is typically about 1 Gyr, virtually independent of halo mass. Recycled material is re-accreted farther out in the disk and with typically about 2-3 times more angular momentum. These results elucidate and quantify how the baryon cycle plausibly regulates star formation and alters the angular momentum distribution of disk material across the halo mass range where most of cosmic star formation occurs.},

abstract = {Using HST/WFC3 imaging taken as part of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), we examine the role that major galaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity at z{\~{}}2. Our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (Lx {\~{}} 1E42-1E44 erg/s) AGN at 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5 that are selected using the 4 Msec Chandra observations in the Chandra Deep Field South, the deepest X-ray observations to date. Employing visual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies of the AGN host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216 non-active galaxies at the same redshift. We find that most of the AGN reside in disk galaxies (51.4{\%}), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids (27.8{\%}). Roughly 16.7{\%} of the AGN hosts have highly disturbed morphologies and appear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts (55.6{\%}) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. These fractions are statistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that show similar morphological disturbances. These results suggest that the hosts of moderate-luminosity AGN are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing merger or interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z{\~{}}2. The high disk fraction observed among the AGN hosts also appears to be at odds with predictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant AGN fueling mode at z{\~{}}2, even at moderate X-ray luminosities. Although we cannot rule out that minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presence of a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests that secular processes play a greater role in fueling AGN activity at z{\~{}}2 than previously thought.},

abstract = {Motivated by the observed connection between molecular hydrogen (H2) and star formation, we present a method for tracking the non-equilibrium abundance and cooling processes of H2 and H2-based star formation in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic simulations. The local abundances of H2 are calculated by integrating over the hydrogen chemical network. This calculation includes the gas-phase and dust grain formation of H2, shielding of HI and H2, and photodissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation from nearby stellar populations. Because this model does not assume equilibrium abundances, it is particularly well suited for simulations that model low-metallicity environments, such as dwarf galaxies and the early Universe. We further introduce an explicit link between star formation and local H2 abundance. This link limits star formation to "star-forming regions," represented by areas with abundant H2.   With this implementation, we determine the effect of H2 on star formation in a cosmological simulation of a dwarf galaxy. This simulation is the first cosmological simulation with non-equilibrium H2 abundances to be integrated to a redshift of zero or to include efficient SN feedback. We find that our simulations are consistent with the observed Tully-Fisher, global Kennicutt-Schmidt, and resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. We find that the inclusion of shielding of both the atomic and molecular hydrogen and, to a lesser extent, the additional cooling from H2 at temperatures between 200 and 5000 K increases the amount of cold gas in the galaxies. The changes to the ISM result in an increased amount of cold, dense gas in the disk of the galaxy and the formation of a clumpier interstellar media (ISM). The explicit link between star formation and H2 and the clumpier ISM results in a bluer galaxy with a greater spatial distribution of star formation at a redshift of zero. (abridged)},

Here we investigate the relationship between BH mass and host galaxy total stellar mass using a sample of 262 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the nearby Universe (z {\textless} 0.055), as well as 81 galaxies with dynamical BH masses. The vast majority of our AGN sample is constructed using Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and searching for Seyfert-like narrow-line ratios and broad H-alpha emission. BH masses are estimated using standard virial techniques. We also include a small number of dwarf galaxies with total stellar masses M{\_}stellar {\textless} 10{\^{}}9.5 Msun and a sub-sample of the reverberation-mapped AGNs. Total stellar masses of all 343 galaxies are calculated in the most consistent manner feasible using color-dependent mass-to-light ratios.

However, the relation defined by the AGNs has a normalization that is lower by more than an order of magnitude, with a BH-to-total stellar mass fraction of M{\_}BH/M{\_}stellar {\~{}} 0.025{\%} across the stellar mass range 10{\^{}}8 {\textless} M{\_}stellar/Msun {\textless} 10{\^{}}12.

abstract = {Tracking the evolution of high redshift seed black hole masses to late times, we examine the observable signatures today. These massive initial black hole seeds form at extremely high redshifts from the direct collapse of pre-galactic gas discs. Populating dark matter halos with seeds formed in this fashion, we follow the mass assembly history of these black holes to the present time using a Monte-Carlo merger tree approach. Utilizing this formalism, we predict the black hole mass function at high redshifts and at the present time; the integrated mass density of black holes in the Universe; the luminosity function of accreting black holes as a function of redshift and the scatter in observed, local M-sigma relation. Comparing the predictions of the `light' seed model with these massive seeds we find that significant differences appear predominantly at the low mass end of the present day black hole mass function. However, all our models predict that low surface brightness, bulge-less galaxies with large discs are least likely to be sites for the formation of massive seed black holes at high redshifts. The efficiency of seed formation at high redshifts has a direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction in galaxies at z=0. This effect is more pronounced for low mass galaxies. This is the key discriminant between the models studied here and the Population III remnant `light' seed model. We find that there exists a population of low mass galaxies that do not host nuclear black holes. Our prediction of the shape of the M-sigma relation at the low mass end and increased scatter has recently been corroborated by observations.},

abstract = {We present a sample of 151 dwarf galaxies (108.5 {\textless}{\~{}} M sstarf {\textless}{\~{}} 109.5 M ⊙) that exhibit optical spectroscopic signatures of accreting massive black holes (BHs), increasing the number of known active galaxies in this stellar-mass range by more than an order of magnitude. Utilizing data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 and stellar masses from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, we have systematically searched for active BHs in {\~{}}25,000 emission-line galaxies with stellar masses comparable to the Magellanic Clouds and redshifts z {\textless} 0.055. Using the narrow-line [O III]/H$\beta$ versus [N II]/H$\alpha$ diagnostic diagram, we find photoionization signatures of BH accretion in 136 galaxies, a small fraction of which also exhibit broad H$\alpha$ emission. For these broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, we estimate BH masses using standard virial techniques and find a range of 105 {\textless}{\~{}} M BH {\textless}{\~{}} 106 M ⊙ and a median of M BH {\~{}} 2 × 105 M ⊙. We also detect broad H$\alpha$ in 15 galaxies that have narrow-line ratios consistent with star-forming galaxies. Follow-up observations are required to determine if these are true type 1 AGN or if the broad H$\alpha$ is from stellar processes. The median absolute magnitude of the host galaxies in our active sample is Mg = -18.1 mag, which is {\~{}}1-2 mag fainter than previous samples of AGN hosts with low-mass BHs. This work constrains the smallest galaxies that can form a massive BH, with implications for BH feedback in low-mass galaxies and the origin of the first supermassive BH seeds.},

The shallower slope found by the latter authors (3.75 vs. 4.8) is due partly to the use of a regression algorithm that ignores measurement errors and partly to the value of the velocity dispersion adopted for a single galaxy, the Milky Way. A steeper relation is shown to provide a better fit to black hole masses derived from reverberation mapping studies. Combining the stellar dynamical, gasdynamical, and reverberation mapping mass estimates, we derive a best-fit relation M•=1.30(+/-0.36)×108 Msolar($\sigma$c/200 km s-1)4.72(+/-0.36).},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the evolution of gravitationally unstable pre-galactic discs that result from the collapse of haloes at high redshift z {\~{}} 10 or so, which have not yet been enriched by metals. In cases where molecular hydrogen formation is suppressed, the discs are maintained at a temperature of a few thousand Kelvin. However, when molecular hydrogen is present, cooling can proceed down to a few hundred Kelvin. Analogous to the case of the larger-scale protogalactic discs, we assume that the evolution of these discs is mainly driven by angular momentum redistribution induced by the development of gravitational instabilities in the disc. We also properly take into account the possibility of disc fragmentation. We thus show that this simple model naturally predicts the formation of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of such discs and provides a robust determination of their mass distribution as a function of halo properties. We estimate that roughly 5 per cent of discs resulting from the collapse of haloes with M {\~{}} 107Msolar should host a massive black hole with a mass MBH {\~{}} 105Msolar. We confirm our arguments with time-dependent calculations of the evolution of the surface density and of the accretion rate in these primordial discs. The luminosity of the outer, colder disc is expected to be very low (in the range of a few thousand Lsolar), while the formation of the black hole is expected to produce a burst with a luminosity of a few times 109Lsolar. This mechanism offers an efficient way to form seed black holes at high redshift. The predicted masses for our black hole seeds enable the comfortable assembly of 109-Msolar black holes powering the luminous quasars detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z = 6 for a concordance cosmology.},

abstract = {A sample of very high resolution cosmological disk galaxy simulations is used to investigate the evolution of galaxy disk sizes back to redshift 1 within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Artificial images in the rest-frame B band are generated, allowing for a measurement of disk scale lengths using surface brightness profiles as observations would, and avoiding any assumption that light must follow mass as previous models have assumed. We demonstrate that these simulated disks are an excellent match to the observed magnitude-size relation for both local disks and for disks at z = 1 in the magnitude/mass range of overlap. We disentangle the evolution seen in the population as a whole from the evolution of individual disk galaxies. In agreement with observations, our simulated disks undergo roughly 1.5 mag arcsec-2 of surface brightness dimming since z = 1. We find evidence that evolution in the magnitude-size plane varies by mass, such that galaxies with M * {\textgreater}= 109 M sun undergo more evolution in size than luminosity, while dwarf galaxies tend to evolve potentially more in luminosity. The disks grow in such a way as to stay on roughly the same stellar-mass-size relation with time. Finally, due to an evolving stellar-mass-star-formation-rate (SFR) relation, a galaxy at a given stellar mass (or size) at z = 1 will reside in a more massive halo and have a higher SFR, and thus a higher luminosity, than a counterpart of the same stellar mass at z = 0.},

abstract = {The first bound star-forming systems in the universe are predicted to form at redshifts of about 30 and to have masses of the order of 10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun. Although their sizes and masses are similar to those of present star-forming regions, their temperatures are expected to be much higher because cooling is provided only by trace amounts of molecular hydrogen. Several recent simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds have converged on a thermal regime where the density is about 10{\^{}}3-10{\^{}}4 cm{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} and the temperature is about 300 K; under these conditions the Jeans mass is of the order of 10{\^{}}3 M{\_}sun, and all of the simulations show the formation of clumps with masses of this order. The temperatures in these clumps subsequently rise slowly as they collapse, so little if any further fragmentation is expected. As a result, the formation of predominantly massive or very massive stars is expected, and star formation with a normal present-day IMF seems very unlikely. The most massive early stars are expected to collapse to black holes, and these in turn are predicted to end up concentrated near the centers of present-day large galaxies. Such black holes may play a role in the origin of AGNs, and the heavy elements produced by somewhat less massive stars also formed at early times may play an important role in chemically enriching the inner parts of large galaxies and quasars.

abstract = {We investigate the role of host galaxy classification and black hole mass (MBH) in a heterogeneous sample of 276 mostly nearby (z {\textless} 0.1) X-ray and IR-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN). Around 90 per cent of Seyfert 1 AGN in bulge-dominated host galaxies (without disc contamination) span a very narrow range in the observed 12 m to 2-10 keV luminosity ratio (1 {\textless} RIR/X {\textless} 7). This narrow dispersion incorporates all possible variations among AGN central engines, including accretion mechanism and efficiency, disc opening angle, orientation to sightline, covering fraction of absorbing material, patchiness of X-ray corona and measured variability. As a result, all models of X-ray and IR production in AGN are very strongly constrained. Among Seyfert 1 AGN, median X-ray and IR luminosities increase with black hole mass at {\textgreater}99 per cent confidence. Using ring morphology of the host galaxy as a proxy for lack of tidal interaction, we find that AGN luminosity in host galaxies within 70 Mpc is independent of host galaxy interaction for [{\~{}}] Gyr, suggesting that the timescale of AGN activity due to secular evolution is much shorter than that due to tidal interactions. We find that LINER hosts have lower 12 m luminosity than the median 12 m luminosity of normal disc- and bulge-dominated galaxies which may represent observational evidence for past epochs of feedback that suppressed star formation in LINER host galaxies. We propose that nuclear ULXs may account for the X-ray emission from LINER 2s without flat-spectrum, compact radio cores. We confirmed the robustness of our results in X-rays by comparing them with the 14-195 keV 22-month BAT survey of AGN, which is all-sky and unbiased by photoelectric absorption.},

We then extend the MHF code in order to track the orbital evolution of gravitationally bound objects through any given cosmological N-body simulation - our so-called `MLAPM halo tracker' (MHT). The mode of operation of MHT is demonstrated using a series of eight high-resolution N-body simulations of galaxy clusters. Each of these haloes hosts more than one million particles within their virial radii rvir. We use MHT as well as MHF to follow the temporal evolution of hundreds of individual satellites, and show that the radial distribution of these substructure satellites follows a `universal' radial distribution irrespective of the environment and formation history of the host halo. This in fact might pose another problem for simulations of cold dark matter structure formation, as there are recent findings by Taylor, Silk {\&} Babul that the Milky Way satellites are found preferentially closer to the Galactic Centre and simulations underestimate the amount of central substructure. Further, this universal substructure profile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. The halo finder MHF will become part of the open source MLAPM distribution.},

abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revo- lutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass M• and the velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the bulge component of the host galaxy.Together with sim- ilar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Con- clusions based on one set of correlations from M• ∼ 109.5M? in brightest cluster ellipticals to M• ∼ 106M? in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our under- standing of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105−106M? are found inmany bulgeless galaxies.Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any M• correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution.},

abstract = {New black-hole mass estimates are presented for a sample of 72 AGN covering three decades in optical luminosity. Using a sub-sample of Seyfert galaxies, which have black-hole mass estimates from both reverberation mapping and stellar velocity dispersions, we investigate the geometry of the AGN broad-line region (BLR). It is demonstrated that a model in which the orbits of the line-emitting material have a flattened geometry is favoured over randomly orientated orbits. Using this model we investigate the M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}-L{\_}{\{}bulge{\}} relation for a combined 90-object sample, consisting of the AGN plus a sample of 18 nearby inactive elliptical galaxies with dynamical black-hole mass measurements. It is found that, for all reasonable mass-to-light ratios, the M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}-L{\_}{\{}bulge{\}} relation is equivalent to a linear scaling between bulge and black-hole mass. The best-fitting normalization of the M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}-M{\_}{\{}bulge{\}} relation is found to be M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}=0.0012M{\_}{\{}bulge{\}}, in agreement with recent black-hole mass studies based on stellar velocity dispersions. Furthermore, the scatter around the M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}-L{\_}{\{}bulge{\}} relation for the full sample is found to be significantly smaller than has been previously reported (Delta $\backslash$log M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}=0.39 dex). Finally, using the nearby inactive elliptical galaxy sample alone, it is shown that the scatter in the M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}-L{\_}{\{}bulge{\}} relation is only 0.33 dex, comparable to that of the M{\_}{\{}bh{\}}-sigma relation. These results indicate that reliable black-hole mass estimates can be obtained for high redshift galaxies.},

We use merger trees from a cosmological N-body simulation known as Via Lactea II (VL-2) as a framework to test two merger-driven semi-analytic recipes for black hole growth that include dynamical friction, tidal stripping, and gravitational wave recoil in over 20,000 merger tree realizations. First, we apply a Fundamental Plane limited (FPL) model to the growth of Sgr A*, which drives the central black hole to a maximum mass limited by the Black Hole Fundamental Plane after every merger. Next, we present a new model that allows for low-level Prolonged Gas Accretion (PGA) during the merger. We find that both models can generate a Sgr A* mass black hole. We predict a population of massive black holes in local field dwarf galaxies - if the VL-2 simulation is representative of the growth of the Local Group, we predict up to 35 massive black holes ({\textless} 10{\^{}}6 Msun) in Local Group field dwarfs. We also predict that hundreds of {\textless} 10{\^{}}5 Msun black holes fail to merge, and instead populate the Milky Way halo, with the most massive of them at roughly the virial radius. In addition, we find that there may be hundreds of massive black holes ejected from their hosts into the nearby intergalactic medium due to gravitational wave recoil.

abstract = {We present a detailed calculation of the propagation of AGN-like ionizing radiation through the intergalactic space. We model the ionization state of absorbing clouds, and show that the universe will be more opaque above {\$}4\backslash,{\$}Ryd than previously estimated. Singly ionized helium in $\backslash$Lya forest clouds and Lyman-limit systems is found to be very efficient in reprocessing soft X-ray, helium-ionizing photons into ultraviolet, hydrogen-ionizing ones. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of the absorbed primary photons (emitted, e.g., by quasar sources) will be reradiated by the photoionized gas through $\backslash$Lya line emission, two-photon continuum, and recombination continuum radiation. In the light of new data and recent studies, we also reassess the contribution of the QSOs observed in optical surveys to the UV extragalactic background, and find that the stochastic reprocessing of quasar Lyman continuum radiation by hydrogen and helium along the line of sight will significantly affect the amplitude, spectral shape, and fluctuations properties of the metagalactic flux. In a scenario in which QSOs are the primary source of ionizing photons in the universe, the integrated $\backslash$HI $\backslash$Lya emission at {\$}z=0{\$} from photoionized $\backslash$Lya clouds and Lyman-limit systems is found to be at a level of less than 5$\backslash${\%} of current observational limits on the far-UV extragalactic radiation flux.

The attenuated direct quasar emission plus recombination radiation from intergalactic gas appears to provide enough hydrogen-ionizing photons to satisfy the proximity effect at large redshift.

abstract = {The evolution in the comoving space density of the global average galaxy star formation rate (SFR) out to a redshift around unity is well established. Beyond z{\~{}}1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is flat or even increasing, contrary to early indications of a turnover. Some recent analyses of z{\~{}}6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a decline from z=3 to z{\~{}}6, but there is still very little constraint on the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a decade, numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density spanning z=0 to as high as z{\~{}}6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy evolution, and a summary of existing SFR density measurements is presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the entire range 0{\textless}z{\textless}{\~{}}6, and it can be used to constrain the evolution of the luminosity function (LF) for star-forming galaxies. The LF evolution for star-forming galaxies has been previously explored using optical source counts, as well as radio source counts at 1.4 GHz, and a well-known degeneracy between luminosity evolution [L{\~{}}(1+z)Q] and density evolution [$\phi${\~{}}(1+z)P] is found. Combining the constraints from the global SFR density evolution with those from the 1.4 GHz radio source counts at submillijansky levels allows this degeneracy to be broken and a best-fitting evolutionary form to be established. The preferred evolution in a H0=70,$\Omega$M=0.3,$\Omega$$\Lambda$=0.7 cosmology from these combined constraints is Q=2.70+/-0.60, P=0.15+/-0.60.},

@article{Begelman2006,
abstract = {We describe a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can form directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need for seed black holes left over from early star formation. Self-gravitating gas in dark matter halos can lose angular momentum rapidly via runaway, global dynamical instabilities, the so-called "bars within bars" mechanism. This leads to the rapid buildup of a dense, self-gravitating core supported by gas pressure - surrounded by a radiation pressure-dominated envelope - which gradually contracts and is compressed further by subsequent infall. These conditions lead to such high temperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically by thermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation and rapid growth of a central black hole. We estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typical conditions in metal-free halos with T{\_}vir {\~{}} 10{\^{}}4 K, which are the most likely to be susceptible to runaway infall. The initial black hole should have a mass of {\textless}{\~{}}20 solar masses, but in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate until it reaches {\~{}} 10{\^{}}4-10{\^{}}6 solar masses. Rapid growth may be limited by feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the mass supply by star formation or halo mergers. Even if super-Eddington growth stops at $\backslash${\~{}}10{\^{}}3-10{\^{}}4 solar masses, this process would give black holes ample time to attain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds for all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.},

abstract = {We present a study of the host galaxies of AGN selected from the zCOSMOS survey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and star formation are explicitly linked up to z{\~{}}1. We identify 152 galaxies that harbor AGN, based on XMM observations of 7543 galaxies (i{\textless}22.5). Star formation rates (SFRs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the [OII]3727 emission-line, corrected for an AGN contribution. We find that the majority of AGN hosts have significant levels of star formation with a distribution spanning {\~{}}1-100 Msun yr{\^{}}-1. The close association between AGN activity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the AGN fraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-frame color (U-V) and spectral index Dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selection alleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when using luminosity-limited samples. We also find that the SFRs of AGN hosts evolve with cosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population and explains the low SFRs in AGNs (z{\textless}0.3) from the SDSS. We conclude that the conditions most conducive for AGN activity are a massive host galaxy and a large reservoir of gas. Furthermore, a direct correlation between mass accretion rate onto SMBHs and SFR is shown to be weak although the average ratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for a co-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. Our findings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an AGN lifetime substantially shorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regarding fueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [Abridged].},

These events naturally create a population of "wandering" BHs that are the remnants of stripped satellite cores; galaxies like the Milky Way may host 5-15 of these objects within their halos. The satellites that harbor BH seeds are comparable to Local Group dwarf galaxies such as the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds; these galaxies are promising candidates to host nearby intermediate-mass BHs.

abstract = {The authors present a general discussion of spherical, nonrelativistic blastwaves in an astrophysical context. A variety of effects has been included: expansion of the ambient medium, gravitation, and an embedded fluid of clouds capable of exchanging mass, energy, or momentum with the medium. The authors also consider cases of energy injection due either to a central source or to detonations. Cosmological solutions are extensively treated. Most attention is devoted to problems in which it is permissible to assume self-similarity, as in the prototype Sedov-Taylor blastwave. A general virial theorem for blastwaves is derived. For self-similar blastwaves, the radius varies as a power of the time, Rs∝t$\eta$. The integral properties of the solution are completely specified by two dimensionless numbers measuring the relative importance of thermal and kinetic energy. The authors find certain exact kinematical relations and a variety of analytic approximations to determine these numbers with varying degrees of accuracy. The approximations may be based on assumptions about the internal density distributions (e.g., shell-like), pressure distribution, or velocity distribution. In many cases exact conditions from, for example, boundary conditions or other constraints may be used to determine unspecified parameters. One new set of exact integral constraints has been derived. The various approximation schemes are tested with known solutions. The authors find that for blastwaves in which the flow extends to the origin, the assumption that the internal velocity is linear with radius is reasonably accurate. For blastwaves in which an interior vacuum develops, the equally simple approximation of constant interior velocity is accurate. These lowest-order approximations are shown to give numerical coefficients in the relation R=const×t$\eta$ which are accurate to about 1-2{\%}. The higher-order approximations show an accuracy that in some cases equals that obtained, to date, by direct numerical integration. In addition to the new methods presented, the authors have obtained new results for evaporative blastwaves, impeded blastwaves, blastwaves with cloud crushing, bubbles, cosmological blastwaves (self-similar and non-self-similar, radiative and nonradiative), blastwaves in a wind, and detonations. Some of the new results found are exact. Included are the radiative, cosmological self-similar solution, appropriate to the universe (z{\textgreater}10) when inverse Compton cooling is efficient [lnR=const+(lnt)(15+√17)/24], and certain properties of the solutions mentioned above. In a series of appendixes several related issues are treated: energy conservation for multicomponent fluid in an expanding universe; central and edge derivatives of physical quantities in self-similar adiabatic blastwaves; shock jump conditions including energy input (detonations), and a variety of other matters.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that Type I supernovae (SN I) are the main producers of iron-peak elements in the Galaxy. In addition, observations of SN I also indicate the existence of appreciable amounts of intermediate elements like O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca in the outer layers of the exploding star. In an earlier paper it was shown that such an abundance pattern can be produced by carbon deflagration models of accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems or stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) which ignite central carbon burning explosively. In the present study, explosive nucleosynthesis results of those carbon deflagration supernovae are presented in detail. Special emphasis is given to the discussion of burning conditions and corresponding nucleosynthesis products, and the nuclear uncertainties which govern the amount of electron captures in the central part of the core. The latter gives constraints on the isotopic composition of the iron peak elements. The overproduction of Fe-54 + Ni-58 is still occurring. Assuming that SN I which contributed to the abundances in the solar system originated from white dwarfs with a metallicity range Z/solar-Z = 0.1-1, might remove this overproduction. This would allow for SN I to be the major contributors of Fe-group nuclei in galactic nucleosynthesis.},

For each isochrone, we give the current mass, effective temperatures, bolometric and visual magnitudes, (U-B), (B-V), (V-R), (V-I), (V-J), (V-H), and (V-K) colors, and the luminosity function for the case of the Salpeter law. In addition to this, integrated magnitudes and colors at several characteristic points are also presented together with the mass of the remnant star when appropriate.

abstract = {We compare the central mass distribution of galaxies simulated with three different models of the interstellar medium (ISM) with increasing complexity: primordial (H+He) cooling down to 10{\^{}}4 K, additional cooling via metal lines and to lower temperatures, and molecular hydrogen (H{\_}2) with shielding of atomic and molecular hydrogen in addition to metal line cooling. In order to analyze the effect of these models, we follow the evolution of four field galaxies with V{\_}peak {\textless} 120 km/s to a redshift of zero using high-resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic simulations in a fully cosmological LCDM context. The spiral galaxies produced in simulations with either primordial cooling or H{\_}2 physics have bulge magnitudes and scale lengths very similar to observed galaxies and realistic, rising rotation curves. In contrast, the metal line cooling simulation produced galaxies with more massive and concentrated bulges and with the peaked rotation curves typical of most previous LCDM simulations of spiral galaxies. The less-massive bulges and non-peaked rotation curves in the galaxies simulated with primordial cooling or H{\_}2 are linked to changes in the angular momentum distribution of the baryons. These galaxies had smaller amounts of low-angular momentum baryons because of increased gas loss from stellar feedback. When there is only primordial cooling, the star forming gas is hotter and the feedback-heated gas cools more slowly than when metal line cooling is included and so requires less energy to be expelled. When H{\_}2 is included, the accompanying shielding produces large amounts of clumpy, cold gas where H{\_}2 forms. Star formation in clumpy gas results in more concentrated supernova feedback and greater efficiency of mass loss. The higher feedback efficiency causes a decrease of low-angular momentum material and formation of realistic bulges. (abridged)},

abstract = {We present a computer code written in c that is designed to simulate structure formation from collisionless matter. The code is purely grid-based and uses a recursively refined Cartesian grid to solve Poisson's equation for the potential, rather than obtaining the potential from a Green's function. Refinements can have arbitrary shapes and in practice closely follow the complex morphology of the density field that evolves. The time-step shortens by a factor of 2 with each successive refinement. Competing approaches to N-body simulation are discussed from the point of view of the basic theory of N-body simulation. It is argued that an appropriate choice of softening length {\{}$\epsilon${\}} is of great importance and that {\{}$\epsilon${\}} should be at all points an appropriate multiple of the local interparticle separation. Unlike tree and P{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}M codes, multigrid codes automatically satisfy this requirement. We show that at early times and low densities in cosmological simulations, {\{}$\epsilon${\}} needs to be significantly smaller relative to the interparticle separation than in virialized regions. Tests of the ability of the code's Poisson solver to recover the gravitational fields of both virialized haloes and Zel'dovich waves are presented, as are tests of the code's ability to reproduce analytic solutions for plane-wave evolution. The times required to conduct a {\{}$\Lambda${\}}CDM cosmological simulation for various configurations are compared with the times required to complete the same simulation with the ART, AP{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}M and GADGET codes. The power spectra, halo mass functions and halo-halo correlation functions of simulations conducted with different codes are compared. The code is available from http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/users/MLAPM.},

abstract = {Not the way one might have thought. In hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation, some gas follows the traditionally envisioned route, shock heating to the halo virial temperature before cooling to the much lower temperature of the neutral ISM. But most gas enters galaxies without ever heating close to the virial temperature, gaining thermal energy from weak shocks and adiabatic compression, and radiating it just as quickly. This ``cold mode'' accretion is channeled along filaments, while the conventional, ``hot mode'' accretion is quasi-spherical. Cold mode accretion dominates high redshift growth by a substantial factor, while at z{\textless}1 the overall accretion rate declines and hot mode accretion has greater relative importance. The decline of the cosmic star formation rate at low z is driven largely by geometry, as the typical cross section of filaments begins to exceed that of the galaxies at their intersections.},

@article{Moster2010,
abstract = {We use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in which they reside. We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the SDSS at z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all redshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

abstract = {We use a sample of close galaxy pairs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) to investigate in what environments galaxy mergers occur and how the results of these mergers depend on differences in local galaxy density. The galaxies are quantified morphologically using two-dimensional bulge-plus-disk decompositions and compared to a control sample matched in stellar mass, redshift and local projected density. Lower density environments have fractionally more galaxy pairs with small projected separations (r{\_}p) and relative velocities (Delta v), but even high density environments contain significant populations of pairs with parameters that should be conducive to interactions. Metrics of asymmetry and colour are used to identify merger activity and triggered star formation. The location of star formation is inferred by distinguishing bulge and disk colours and calculating bulge fractions from the SDSS images. Galaxies in the lowest density environments show the largest changes in star formation rate, asymmetry and bulge-total fractions at small separations, accompanied by bluer bulge colours. At the highest local densities, the only galaxy property to show an enhancement in the closest pairs is asymmetry. We interpret these results as evidence that whilst interactions (leading to tidal distortions) occur at all densities, triggered star formation is seen only in low-to-intermediate density environments. We suggest that this is likely due to the typically higher gas fractions of galaxies in low density environments. Finally, by cross-correlating our sample of galaxy pairs with a cluster catalogue, we investigate the dependence of interactions on clustercentric distance. It is found that for close pairs the fraction of asymmetric galaxies is highest in the cluster centres.},

We show that the model of Kauffmann {\&} Haehnelt, in which bulges and supermassive black holes both form during major mergers, produces a correlation between Mbh and $\sigma$ with a slope and scatter comparable to the observed relation. In the model the Mbh-$\sigma$ relation is significantly tighter than the correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity, or the correlation between bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion. There are two reasons for this: (i) the gas masses of bulge progenitors depend on the velocity dispersion but not on the formation epoch of the bulge, whereas the stellar masses of the progenitors depend on both; (ii) mergers between galaxies move black holes along the observed Mbh-$\sigma$ relation, even at late times when the galaxies are gas-poor and black holes grow mainly the by merging of pre-existing black holes. We conclude that the small scatter in the observed Mbh-$\sigma$ relation is consistent with a picture in which bulges and black holes form over a wide range in redshift.},

The stellar progenitor disks are destroyed by violent relaxation during the merging and most of their stars form a classical bulge, while the remaining form a thick disk and its bar. A new stellar disk forms subsequently and gradually in the remnant from the gas accreted mainly from the halo. It is vertically thin and well extended in its equatorial plane. A bar starts forming before the disk is fully in place, contrary to what is assumed in idealised simulations of isolated bar-forming galaxies. It has morphological features such as ansae and boxy/peanut bulges. Stars of different ages populate different parts of the box/peanut. A disky pseudobulge forms also, so that by the end of the simulation, all three types of bulges coexist. The oldest stars are found in the classical bulge, followed by those of the thick disk, then by those in the thin disk. The youngest stars are in the spiral arms and the disky pseudobulge. The disk surface density profiles are of type II (exponential with downbending), and the circular velocity curves are flat and show that the disks are submaximum in these examples: two clearly so and one near-borderline between maximum and submaximum. On average, only roughly between 10 and 20{\%} of the stellar mass is in the classical bulge of the final models, i.e. much less than in previous simulations.},

Gas metallicities are measured, for an initial sample of nine star forming galaxies at z {\~{}} 3.5, by means of optical nebular lines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are accurately determined by using Spitzer-IRAC data, which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in these distant galaxies. When compared with previous surveys, the mass-metallicity relation inferred at z {\~{}} 3.5 shows an evolution much stronger than observed at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even in massive galaxies, indicating that z {\~{}} 3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star formation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are also indications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is stronger relative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemical version of the galaxy downsizing. The mass-metallicity relation observed at z {\~{}} 3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchical evolutionary models. Such discrepancies suggest that at z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies are assembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies with low star formation efficiency. The bulk of the star formation and metallicity evolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into bigger systems.

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of high-redshift seed black hole masses at late times and their observational signatures. The massive black hole seeds studied here form at extremely high redshifts from the direct collapse of pre-galactic gas discs. Populating dark matter haloes with seeds formed in this way, we follow the mass assembly of these black holes to the present time using a Monte Carlo merger tree. Using this machinery, we predict the black hole mass function at high redshifts and at the present time, the integrated mass density of black holes and the luminosity function of accreting black holes as a function of redshift. These predictions are made for a set of three seed models with varying black hole formation efficiency. Given the accuracy of present observational constraints, all three models can be adequately fitted. Discrimination between the models appears predominantly at the low-mass end of the present-day black hole mass function which is not observationally well constrained. However, all our models predict that low surface brightness, bulgeless galaxies with large discs are least likely to be sites for the formation of massive seed black holes at high redshifts. The efficiency of seed formation at high redshifts has a direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction in galaxies at z = 0. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass galaxies. This is the key discriminant between the models studied here and the Population III remnant seed model. We find that there exist a population of low-mass galaxies that do not host nuclear black holes. Our prediction of the shape of the MBH-$\sigma$ relation at the low-mass end is in agreement with the recent observational determination from the census of low-mass galaxies in the Virgo cluster.},

In particular, we discuss the initial conditions for Population III star formation, as given by variants of the cold dark matter cosmology. Numerical simulations have investigated the collapse and the fragmentation of metal-free gas, showing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. The exact determination of the stellar masses, and the precise form of the primordial initial mass function, is still hampered by our limited understanding of the accretion physics and the protostellar feedback effects. We address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars to the familiar mode dominated by low-mass stars at later times. We show how complementary observations, both at high redshifts and in our local cosmic neighborhood, can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation.},

abstract = {Using high resolution SPH simulations in a fully cosmological Lambda CDM context we study the formation of a bright disk dominated galaxy that originates from a "wet" major merger at z=0.8. The progenitors of the disk galaxy are themselves disk galaxies that formed from early major mergers between galaxies with blue colors. A substantial thin stellar disk grows rapidly following the last major merger and the present day properties of the final remnant are typical of early type spiral galaxies, with an i band B/D {\~{}}0.65, a disk scale length of 7.2 kpc, g-r = 0.5 mag, an HI line width (W{\_}{\{}20{\}}/2) of 238 km/sec and total magnitude i = -22.4. The key ingredients for the formation of a dominant stellar disk component after a major merger are: i) substantial and rapid accretion of gas through cold flows followed at late times by cooling of gas from the hot phase, ii) supernova feedback that is able to partially suppress star formation during mergers and iii) relative fading of the spheroidal component. The gas fraction of the progenitors' disks does not exceed 25{\%} at z{\textless}3, emphasizing that the continuous supply of gas from the local environment plays a major role in the regrowth of disks and in keeping the galaxies blue. The results of this simulation alleviate the problem posed for the existence of disk galaxies by the high likelihood of interactions and mergers for galaxy sized halos at relatively low z.},

abstract = {We employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the growth of massive black holes (BHs) at high redshifts subject to BH merger recoils from gravitational wave emission. We select the most massive dark matter halo at z=6 from the Millennium simulation, and resimulate its formation at much higher resolution including gas physics and a model for BH seeding, growth and feedback. Assuming that the initial BH seeds are relatively massive, of the order of 10{\^{}}5 Msun, and that seeding occurs around z{\~{}}15 in dark matter haloes of mass 10{\^{}}9-10{\^{}}10 Msun, we find that it is possible to build up supermassive BHs (SMBHs) by z=6 that assemble most of their mass during extended Eddington-limited accretion periods. The properties of the simulated SMBHs are consistent with observations of z=6 quasars in terms of the estimated BH masses and bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within the host halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions of the host galaxy. After a peak in the BH accretion rate at z=6, the most massive BH has become sufficiently massive for the growth to enter into a much slower phase of feedback-regulated accretion. We explore the full range of expected recoils and radiative efficiencies, and also consider models with spinning BHs. In the most `pessimistic' case where BH spins are initially high, we find that the growth of the SMBHs can be potentially hampered if they grow mostly in isolation and experience only a small number of mergers. Whereas BH kicks can expel a substantial fraction of low mass BHs, they do not significantly affect the build up of the SMBHs. On the contrary, a large number of BH mergers has beneficial consequences for the growth of the SMBHs by considerably reducing their spin. [Abridged]},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the establishment and evolution of the empirical correlation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion with redshift. We track the growth and accretion history of massive black holes starting from high redshift using two seeding models:(i) Population III remnants, and (ii) massive seeds from direct gas collapse. Although the seeds do not initially satisfy the {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}} - \backslashsigma{\$} relation, the correlation is established and maintained at all times if self-regulating accretion episodes are associated with major mergers. The massive end of the {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}} - \backslashsigma{\$} relation is established early, and lower mass MBHs migrate over time. How MBHs migrate toward the relation, the slope and the scatter of the relation all depend critically on the seeding model as well as the adopted self-regulation prescription. We expect flux limited AGN surveys and LISA to select accreting and merging MBHs respectively that have already migrated onto the {\$}\backslashmsigma{\$} relation. This is a consequence of major mergers being more common at high redshift for the most massive, biased, galaxies that anchor the {\$}\backslashmsigma{\$} relation early. We also predict the existence of a large population of low mass `hidden' MBHs at high redshift which can easily escape detection. Additionally, we find that if MBH seeds are massive, {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}5 M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, the low-mass end of the {\$}\backslashmsigma{\$} flattens towards this asymptotic value, creating a characteristic `plume'.},

We show that BH masses from reverberation mapping are consistent with the recently discovered relationship between BH mass and galaxy velocity dispersion. Therefore, the bulge luminosities are the probable source of the disagreement, not problems with either method of mass measurement. This result underscores the utility of the BH mass-velocity dispersion relationship.

abstract = {We present a cosmologically motivated model in which the seeds of supermassive black holes form out of the lowest angular momentum gas in protogalaxies at high redshift. We show that, under reasonable assumptions, this leads naturally to a correlation between black hole masses and spheroid properties, as observed today. We assume that the gas in early-forming, rare-peak haloes has a distribution of specific angular momentum similar to that derived for the dark matter in cosmological N-body simulations. This distribution has a significant low angular momentum tail, which implies that every protogalaxy should contain gas that ends up in a high-density disc. In haloes more massive than a critical threshold of ∼7 × 107 M⊙ at z∼ 15, the discs are gravitationally unstable, and experience an efficient Lin–Pringle viscosity that transfers angular momentum outwards and allows mass inflow. We assume that this process continues until the first massive stars disrupt the disc. The seed black holes created in this manner have a characteristic mass of ∼105 M⊙, roughly independent of the redshift of formation. This serves as a lower bound for black hole masses at galactic centres today. The comoving mass density in black hole seeds grows with time, tracking the continuous production of critical-mass haloes, and saturates when cosmic reionization acts to prevent gas cooling in these low-mass systems. By z∼ 15, the comoving mass density becomes comparable to that inferred from observations, with room for appropriate additional luminous growth during a later quasar accretion phase. The hierarchical merger process after z∼ 15 naturally leads to a linear correlation between black hole mass and stellar spheroid mass, with negligible black hole masses in disc-dominated galaxies. The formation of massive seeds at high redshifts, and the relatively important role of mergers in the buildup of today's black holes, are key elements in the proposed scenario.},

From Ks-selected galaxies in the {\~{}}=130 arcmin2 GOODS-S field, we identify 153 distant red galaxies (DRGs) with (J-Ks)Vega{\textgreater}=2.3. This sample is approximately complete in stellar mass for passively evolving galaxies above 1011 Msolar and z{\textless}=3. Roughly half of the DRGs are objects whose optical and near-IR rest-frame light is dominated by evolved stars combined with ongoing star formation (at zmed{\~{}}2.5), and the others are galaxies whose light is dominated by heavily reddened (A1600{\textgreater}{\~{}}4-6 mag) starbursts (at zmed{\~{}}1.7). Very few DRGs ({\textless}{\~{}}10{\%}) have no indication of current star formation. DRGs at z{\~{}}1.5-3 with stellar masses {\textgreater}=1011 Msolar have specific star formation rates (SFRs per unit mass) including the reradiated far-IR emission that range from 0.2 to 10 Gyr-1. Based on the X-ray luminosities and rest-frame near-IR colors, roughly one-quarter of the DRGs contain AGNs, implying that the growth of supermassive black holes coincides with the formation of massive galaxies. At 1.5{\textless}=z{\textless}=3, the DRGs with M{\textgreater}=1011 Msolar have an integrated specific SFR comparable to the global value of all galaxies. In contrast, galaxies at z{\~{}}0.3-0.75 with M{\textgreater}=1011 Msolar have an integrated specific SFR less than the global value and more than an order of magnitude lower than that for massive DRGs. At z{\textless}{\~{}}1, lower mass galaxies dominate the overall cosmic mass assembly. This suggests that the bulk of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at early cosmic epochs and is largely complete by z{\~{}}1.5. Further mass assembly in these galaxies takes place with low specific SFRs.

abstract = {We present spatially extended gas kinematics at parsec-scale resolution for the nuclear regions of four nearby disk galaxies and model them as rotation of a gas disk in the joint potential of the stellar bulge and a putative central black hole. The targets were selected from a larger set of long-slit spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope as part of the Survey of Nearby Nuclei with STIS. They represent the four galaxies (of 24) that display symmetric gas velocity curves consistent with a rotating disk. We derive the stellar mass distribution from the STIS acquisition images adopting the stellar mass-to-light ratio normalized to match ground-based velocity dispersion measurements over a large aperture. Subsequently, we constrain the mass of a putative black hole by matching the gas rotation curve, following two distinct approaches. In the most general case we explore all the possible disk orientations; alternatively, we constrain the gas disk orientation from the dust-lane morphology at similar radii. In the latter case the kinematic data indicate the presence of a central black hole for three of the four objects, with masses of 107-108 Msolar, representing up to {\~{}}0.025{\%} of the host bulge mass. For one object (NGC 2787) the kinematic data alone provide clear evidence for the presence of a central black hole even without external constraints on the disk orientation. These results illustrate directly the need to determine black hole masses by differing methods for a large number of objects, demonstrate that the variance in black hole/bulge mass is much larger than previously claimed, and reinforce the recent finding that the black hole mass is tightly correlated with the bulge stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$.

abstract = {We investigate the nature of gas accretion on to haloes and galaxies at z = 2 using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations run with the moving mesh code AREPO. Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the origin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative comparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches, we find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of accreted gas in massive haloes above ≃1010.5 M⊙. In agreement with previous work, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming in massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats to an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same galaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, for instance, {\textless}20 per cent in haloes with Mhalo ≃ 1011 M⊙. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same halo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, together with a cold accretion rate which is lower by a factor of 2. These discrepancies increase for more massive systems, and we explain both trends in terms of numerical inaccuracies with the standard formulation of SPH. We note, however, that changes in the treatment of interstellar medium physics - feedback, in particular - could modify the observed differences between codes as well as the relative importance of different accretion modes. We explore these differences by evaluating several ways of measuring a cold mode of accretion. As in previous work, the maximum past temperature of gas is compared to either a constant threshold value or some fraction of the virial temperature of each parent halo. We find that the relatively sharp transition from cold- to hot-mode-dominated accretion at halo masses of ≃1011 M⊙ is a consequence of the constant temperature criterion, which can only separate virialized gas above some minimum halo mass. Examining the spatial distribution of accreting gas, we find that the filamentary geometry of accreting gas near the virial radius is a common feature in massive haloes above ≃1011.5 M⊙. Gas filaments in GADGET, however, tend to remain collimated and flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large number of purely numerical `blobs'. These same filamentary gas streams in AREPO show increased heating and disruption at 0.25-0.5rvir and contribute to the hot gas accretion rate in a manner distinct from classical cooling flows.},

abstract = {In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.},

abstract = {We show how the interplay between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and merger history deter-mines whether a galaxy quenches star formation at high redshift. We first simulate, in a full cosmological context, a galaxy of total dynamical mass M vir = 10 12 M at z = 2. Then we systematically alter the accretion history of the galaxy by minimally changing the linear over-density in the initial conditions. This " genetic modification " approach allows the generation of three sets of $\Lambda$CDM initial conditions leading to maximum merger ratios of 1:10, 1:5 and 2:3 respectively. The changes leave the final halo mass, large scale structure and local en-vironment unchanged, providing a controlled numerical experiment. Interaction between the AGN physics and mergers in the three cases lead respectively to a star-forming, temporarily-quenched and permanently-quenched galaxy. However the differences do not primarily lie in the black hole accretion rates, but in the kinetic effects of the merger: the galaxy is resilient against AGN feedback unless its gaseous disk is first disrupted. Typical accretion rates are comparable in the three cases, falling below 0.1 M yr −1 , equivalent to around 2{\%} of the Eddington rate or 10 −3 times the pre-quenching star formation rate, in agreement with obser-vations. This low level of black hole accretion can be sustained even when there is insufficient dense cold gas for star formation. Conversely, supernova feedback is too distributed to gener-ate outflows in high-mass systems, and cannot maintain quenching over periods longer than the halo gas cooling time.},

abstract = {Understanding how seed black holes (BHs) grow into intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes (IMBHs and SMBHs, respectively) has important implications for the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), galaxy evolution and gravitational wave astronomy. Most studies of the cosmological growth and merger history of BHs have used semianalytic models and have concentrated on SMBH growth in luminous galaxies. We have developed a ‘hybrid method' that combines high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations for the haloes' merger history, with semi-analytical recipes for BH pair dynamics and BH gas accretion. We track the assembly of BHs over a large range of final masses – from seed BHs to SMBHs – over widely varying dynamical histories. We used the dynamics of dark matter haloes to track the evolution of seed BHs in three different gas accretion scenarios. We have found that growth of a Sagittarius A*– size of SMBH reaches its maximum mass MSMBH=∼106 M⊙ at z∼ 6 through early gaseous accretion episodes, after which it stays at near constant mass. At the same redshift, the duty cycle of the host AGN ends, hence redshift z= 6 marks the transition from an AGN to a starburst galaxy which eventually becomes the Milky Way. By tracking BH growth as a function of time and mass, we estimate that the IMBH merger rate reaches a maximum of Rmax= 55 yr−1 at z= 11. From IMBH merger rates we calculate NULX= 7 per Milky Way type galaxy per redshift in redshift range 2 ≲z≲ 6.},

Here we investigate the relationship between BH mass and host galaxy total stellar mass using a sample of 262 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the nearby Universe (z {\textless} 0.055), as well as 81 galaxies with dynamical BH masses. The vast majority of our AGN sample is constructed using Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and searching for Seyfert-like narrow-line ratios and broad H-alpha emission. BH masses are estimated using standard virial techniques. We also include a small number of dwarf galaxies with total stellar masses M{\_}stellar {\textless} 10{\^{}}9.5 Msun and a sub-sample of the reverberation-mapped AGNs. Total stellar masses of all 343 galaxies are calculated in the most consistent manner feasible using color-dependent mass-to-light ratios. We find a clear correlation between BH mass and total stellar mass for the AGN host galaxies, with M{\_}BH proportional to M{\_}stellar, similar to that of the early-type galaxies with dynamically-detected BHs. However, the relation defined by the AGNs has a normalization that is lower by more than an order of magnitude, with a BH-to-total stellar mass fraction of M{\_}BH/M{\_}stellar {\~{}} 0.025{\%} across the stellar mass range 10{\^{}}8 {\textless} M{\_}stellar/Msun {\textless} 10{\^{}}12.

abstract = {We compare the set of local galaxies having dynamically measured black holes with a large, unbiased sample of galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We confirm earlier work showing that the majority of black hole hosts have significantly higher velocity dispersions sigma than local galaxies of similar stellar mass. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to illustrate the effect on black hole scaling relations if this bias arises from the requirement that the black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole masses with spatially resolved kinematics. We find that this selection effect artificially increases the normalization of the Mbh-sigma relation by a factor of at least {\~{}}3; the bias for the Mbh-Mstar relation is even larger. Our Monte Carlo simulations and analysis of the residuals from scaling relations both indicate that sigma is more fundamental than Mstar or effective radius. In particular, the Mbh-Mstar relation is mostly a consequence of the Mbh-sigma and sigma-Mstar relations, and is heavily biased by up to a factor of 50 at small masses. This helps resolve the discrepancy between dynamically-based black hole-galaxy scaling relations versus those of active galaxies. Our simulations also disfavour broad distributions of black hole masses at fixed sigma. Correcting for this bias suggests that the calibration factor used to estimate black hole masses in active galaxies should be reduced to values of fvir{\~{}}1. Black hole mass densities should also be proportionally smaller, perhaps implying significantly higher radiative efficiencies/black hole spins. Reducing black hole masses also reduces the gravitational wave signal expected from black hole mergers.},

This new approach accurately follows the orbital decay of a SMBH and drastically improves over commonly used advection methods. The force correction introduced here naturally scales with the force resolution of the simulation and converges as resolution is increased. In controlled experiments we show how the orbital decay of the SMBH closely follows analytical predictions when particle masses are significantly smaller than that of the SMBH. In a cosmological simulation of the assembly of a small galaxy, we show how our method allows for realistic black hole orbits. This approach overcomes the limitations of the advection scheme, where black holes are rapidly and artificially pushed toward the halo center and then forced to merge, regardless of their orbits. We find that SMBHs from merging dwarf galaxies can spend significant time away from the center of the remnant galaxy. Improving the modeling of SMBH orbital decay will help in making robust predictions of the growth, detectability, and merger rates of SMBHs, especially at low galaxy masses or at high redshift.},

abstract = {We present a new stellar feedback model that reproduces superbubbles. Superbubbles from clustered young stars evolve quite differently to individual supernovae and are substantially more efficient at generating gas motions. The essential new components of the model are thermal conduction, sub-grid evaporation and a sub-grid multi-phase treatment for cases where the simulation mass resolution is insufficient to model the early stages of the superbubble. The multi-phase stage is short compared to superbubble lifetimes. Thermal conduction physically regulates the hot gas mass without requiring a free parameter. Accurately following the hot component naturally avoids overcooling. Prior approaches tend to heat too much mass, leaving the hot ISM below {\$}10{\^{}}6{\$} K and susceptible to rapid cooling unless ad-hoc fixes were used. The hot phase also allows feedback energy to correctly accumulate from multiple, clustered sources, including stellar winds and supernovae. We employ high-resolution simulations of a single star cluster to show the model is insensitive to numerical resolution, unresolved ISM structure and suppression of conduction by magnetic fields. We also simulate a Milky Way analog and a dwarf galaxy. Both galaxies show regulated star formation and produce strong outflows.},

abstract = {A study of the IGM metal enrichment using a series of SPH simulations is presented, employing metal cooling and turbulent diffusion of metals and thermal energy. An adiabatic feedback mechanism was adopted where gas cooling was prevented to generate galactic winds without explicit wind particles. The simulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly consistent with observations until z {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.5, and a steady evolution of the universal neutral hydrogen fraction ({\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H I{\}}{\$}). At z=0, about 40{\%} of the baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals (80{\%}-90{\%}) are locked in stars. At higher z the proportion of metals in the IGM is higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The IGM metals primarily reside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history. The metallicity evolution of the gas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse IGM is under enriched at z {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 2.5. Galactic winds most efficiently enrich the IGM for halos in the intermediate mass range {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashsun{\}}{\$} - {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashsun{\}}{\$}. At the low mass end gas is prevented from accreting onto halos and has very low metallicities. At the high mass end, the fraction of halo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar mass fraction of the galaxies. This is likely because of the decrease in star formation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which allows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal diffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content in favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas. Diffusion significantly increases the amount of gas with low metallicities and changes the density-metallicity relation.},

abstract = {For almost two decades the properties of "dwarf" galaxies have challenged the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm of galaxy formation. Most observed dwarf galaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive DM halo with a near constant-density core. Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably form galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar "bulges" and steep central DM profiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies through accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central density of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory with observations of present day dwarfs. This failure is potentially catastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle candidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda{\$}CDM framework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow central DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous interstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions which remove low angular momentum gas. This inhibits the formation of bulges and decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the central kiloparsec. Realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome of galaxy formation in the CDM scenario.},

abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Deltaalpha{\~{}}0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto {\&} Zoccali; Paresce {\&} De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}ndez {\&} Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

abstract = {We describe a mechanism by which supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can form directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need for ‘seed' black holes left over from early star formation. Self-gravitating gas in dark matter haloes can lose angular momentum rapidly via runaway, global dynamical instabilities, the so-called ‘bars within bars' mechanism. This leads to the rapid build-up of a dense, self-gravitating core supported by gas pressure – surrounded by a radiation pressure-dominated envelope – which gradually contracts and is compressed further by subsequent infall. We show that these conditions lead to such high temperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically by thermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation and rapid growth of a central black hole.$\backslash$nWe estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typical conditions in metal-free haloes with Tvir∼ 104-K, which are the most likely to be susceptible to runaway infall. The initial black hole should have a mass of ≲20 M⊙, but in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate until it reaches ∼104–106 M⊙. Rapid growth may be limited by feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the mass supply by star formation or halo mergers. Even if super-Eddington growth stops at ∼103–104 M⊙, this process would give black holes ample time to attain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds for all SMBHs seen in the present Universe.},

Using an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, we constrain these recipes based on well-established observational results. Our star formation recipe is based on that of Katz (1992) with the additional inclusion of physically motivated supernova feedback recipes. We propose a new feedback recipe in which type II supernovae are modelled using an analytical treatment of blastwaves. With this feedback mechanism and a tuning of other star formation parameters, the star formation in our isolated Milky Way-like galaxy is constant and follows the slope and normalisation of the observed Schmidt law. In addition, we reproduce the low density cutoff and filamentary structure of star formation observed in disk galaxies. Our final recipe will enable better comparison of cosmological N-body simulations with observations.},

abstract = {Hierarchical structure formation theory is based on the notion that mergers drive galaxy evolution, so a considerable framework of semi-analytic models and N-body simulations has been constructed to calculate how mergers transform a growing galaxy. However, galaxy mergers are only one type of major dynamical interaction between halos---another class of encounter, a close flyby, has been largely ignored. We use cosmological N-body simulations to reconstruct the entire dynamical interaction history of dark matter halos. We present a careful method of identifying and tracking a dark matter halo which resolves the typical classes of anomalies that occur in N-body data. This technique allows us to robustly follow halos and several hierarchical levels of subhalos as they grow, dissolve, merge, and flyby one another---thereby constructing both a census of the dynamical interactions in a volume and an archive of the dynamical evolution of an individual halo. In addition to a census of mergers, our tool characterizes the frequency of close flyby interactions in the universe. We find that the number of close flyby interactions is comparable to, or even surpasses, the number of mergers for halo masses {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1011 M {\{}{\&}{\}}sun; h -1 at z {\textless}{\~{}} 2. Halo flybys occur so frequently to high-mass halos that they are continually perturbed, unable to reach a dynamical equilibrium. In particular, we find that Milky Way type halos undergo a similar number of flybys as mergers irrespective of mass ratio for z {\textless}{\~{}} 2. We also find tentative evidence that at high redshift, z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 14, flybys are as frequent as mergers. Our results suggest that close halo flybys can play an important role in the evolution of the earliest dark matter halos and their galaxies, and can still influence galaxy evolution at the present epoch. Our companion paper quantifies the effect of close flyby interactions on galaxies and their dark matter hosts.},

Objects with i*-z*{\textgreater}2.2 and z*{\textless}20.2 are selected, and follow-up J band photometry is used to separate L and T type cool dwarfs from high-redshift quasars. We describe the discovery of three new quasars, at z=5.82, 5.99 and 6.28, respectively. Their spectra show strong and broad Ly alpha+NV emission lines, and very strong Ly alpha absorption, with a mean continuum decrement D{\_}A {\textgreater} 0.90. The ARC 3.5m spectrum of the z=6.28 quasar shows that over a range of 300 A immediately blueward of the Ly alpha emission, the average transmitted flux is only 0.003 +/-0.020 times that of the continuum level, consistent with zero flux, and suggesting a tentative detection of the complete Gunn-Peterson trough. The existence of strong metal lines suggests early chemical enrichment in the quasar enviornment. The three new objects, together with the previously published z=5.8 quasar form a complete color-selected flux-limited sample at z{\textgreater}5.8. We estimate that at {\$}z=6{\$}, the comoving density of luminous quasars at M{\_}1450 {\textless} -26.89 (h=0.5, Omega=1)is 1.1x10{\^{}}-9 Mpc{\^{}}-3. This is a factor of {\~{}}2 lower than that at z{\~{}}5, and is consistent with an extrapolation of the observed quasar evolution at low-z. We discuss the contribution of quasars to the ionizing background at z{\~{}}6. The luminous quasars discussed in the paper have central black hole masses of several times 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun by the Eddington argument. Their observed space density provides a sensitive test of models of quasar and galaxy formation at high redshift. (Abridged)},

abstract = {2D stellar kinematics of 48 representative E and S0 galaxies obtained with the SAURON IFS reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours, depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. We define a new parameter LambdaR which involves luminosity weighted averages over the full 2D kinematic field, as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators (SRs, FRs), depending on whether they have LambdaR values within their effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. SRs and FRs are shown to be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the consequence of a biased viewing angle. FRs tend to be relatively low luminosity galaxies. SRs tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. 3 slow rotators of our sample, among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all other SRs contain a large kpc-scale KDC. All FRs show well aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most SRs which exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. In a companion paper (Paper X), we also show that FRs and SRs are distinct classes in terms of their orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of FRs, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards.

Reproducing the observed luminosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation function results in average mass-to-light ratios that are about 35 percent lower than in a LCDM cosmology with Omega{\_}m=0.3 and sigma{\_}8=0.9 (hereafter WMAP1 cosmology). This removes an important problem with previous halo occupation models which had a tendency to predict cluster mass-to-light ratios that were too high. For the WMAP3 cosmology our model yields average mass-to-light ratios, central galaxy luminosities, halo occupation numbers, satellite fractions, and luminosity-gap statistics, that are all in excellent agreement with those obtained from a 2dFGRS group catalogue and from other independent studies. We also use our CLF model to compute the probability distribution P(M|L{\_}cen), that a central galaxy of luminosity L{\_}cen resides in a halo of mass M. We find this distribution to be much broader than what is typically assumed in HOD models, which has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy-galaxy lensing data. Finally, reproducing the luminosity dependence of the pairwise velocity dispersions in the 2dFGRS requires relatively low mass-to-light ratios for clusters and a satellite fraction that decreases strongly with increasing luminosity. This is only marginally consistent with our CLF constraints. We argue that a cosmology with parameters between those of the WMAP1 and WMAP3 cosmologies is likely to yield results with a higher level of consistency.},

For moderate-mass (10{\^{}}6 - 10{\^{}}7 Msun) black holes at z {\~{}} 4, there is a preference to accrete cold flow gas than gas of shocked or merger origin. However, this result is a consequence of the fact that the entire galaxy has a higher fraction of gas from cold flows. In general, each black hole tends to accrete the same fractions of smooth- and merger-accreted gas as is contained in its host galaxy, suggesting that once gas enters a halo it becomes well-mixed, and its origins are erased. We find that the angular momentum of the gas upon halo entry is a more important factor; black holes preferentially accrete gas that had low angular momentum when it entered the galaxy, regardless of whether it was accreted smoothly or through mergers.},

@article{Graham2011,
abstract = {We present an updated and improved Mbh-sigma diagram containing 64 galaxies for which Mbh measurements (not just upper limits) are available. Because of new and increased black hole masses at the high-mass end, and a better representation of barred galaxies at the low-mass end, the 'classical' (all morphological type) Mbh-sigma relation for predicting black hole masses is log (Mbh/M{\&}sun;) = (8.13 $\backslash$pm 0.05) + (5.13 $\backslash$pm 0.34)log [sigma/200 km s-1], with an rms scatter of 0.43 dex. Modifying the regression analysis to correct for a hitherto overlooked sample bias in which black holes with masses {\textless}106 M{\&}sun; are not (yet) detectable, the relation steepens further to give log (Mbh/M{\&}sun;) = (8.15 $\backslash$pm 0.06) + (5.95 $\backslash$pm 0.44)log [sigma/200 km s-1]. We have also updated the 'barless' and 'elliptical-only'Mbh-sigma relations introduced by Graham and Hu in 2008 due to the offset nature of barred galaxies. These relations have a total scatter as low as 0.34 dex and currently define the upper envelope of points in the Mbh-sigma diagram. They also have a slope consistent with a value 5, in agreement with the prediction by Silk {\&} Rees based on feedback from massive black holes in bulges built by monolithic collapse. Using updated virial products and velocity dispersions from 28 active galactic nuclei, we determine that the optimal scaling factor f- which brings their virial products in line with the 64 directly measured black hole masses - is 2.8+0.7-0.5. This is roughly half the value reported by Onken et al. and Woo et al., and consequently halves the mass estimates of most high-redshift quasars. Given that barred galaxies are, on average, located ˜0.5 dex below the 'barless' and 'elliptical-only'Mbh-sigma relations, we have explored the results after separating the samples into barred and non-barred galaxies, and we have also developed a preliminary corrective term to the velocity dispersion based on bar dynamics. In addition, given the recently recognized coexistence of massive black holes and nuclear star clusters, we present the first ever (Mbh+Mnc)-sigma diagram and begin to explore how galaxies shift from their former location in the Mbh-sigma diagram.},
